  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {We propose and evaluate a model for controlling infection patterns defined over rounds or real time in a gossip-based protocol using adaptive fanout. We model three versions of gossip-based protocols: the Synchronous Protocol, the PseudoSynchronous Protocol and the Asynchronous Protocol. Our objective is to ensure that the members of a group receive a desired message within a bounded latency with very high probability. We argue that the most important parameter that controls the latency of message delivery is the fanout used during gossiping, i.e., the number of gossip targets chosen in a particular instance of gossip. We formally analyze the three protocols and provide expressions for fanout. We introduce the idea of using variable fanouts in different rounds in the Synchronous Protocol. We define fanout as a function of time for the Asynchronous Protocol such that an expected infection pattern is observed with high probability. For a better understanding of the theoretical model, we develop a PseudoSynchronous Protocol to highlight the modelling done in order to derive time dependent fanout. We show that our protocols generate θ(n log n) messages, which is optimal for gossip protocols. We aim to use the gossiping mechanism for large-scale group communication with soft real time constraints. This would alleviate the dependence on tree-based deterministic protocols which usually lack scalability. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {WebRTC, Web Real-Time Communications, is revolutionizing the way web users communicate, both in the consumer and enterprise worlds. WebRTC adds standard APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and built-in real-time audio and video capabilities and codecs to browsers without a plug-in. With just a few lines of JavaScript, web developers can add high quality peer-to-peer voice, video, and data channel communications to their collaboration, conferencing, telephony, or even gaming site or application. Written by experts involved in the standardization effort, this book introduces and explains the W3C APIs and the IETF protocols of WebRTC. Packed with figures, example code, and summary tables, this book makes complicated concepts and technologies such as peer-to-peer media and NAT and firewall traversal easy to understand.}
