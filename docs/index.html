<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >The gig economy refers to the work done by casual workers coordinated by a software system. At the time of this writing, the
end customer of the gig economy interacts with a centralized, cloud-based platform (app). This platform is also used to pay for
the services after the job is done to the platform, which in turn is sharing the revenue with the assigned gig worker. The actual
job is done by the gig worker for their customer, making the online platform a tool that supports and manages the effectiveness
of the job.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >This kind of cybernetic system uses the human power of gig workers managed by AI, to extract value for the company
shareholders. The AI component of the platform uses behavioural data represented as all the user (both gig workers
and customers) interactions with the platform to maximize the total revenue generated by the system and the
underlying company that operates it. To optimise the global goal, which is the company revenue, the platform is
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
implementing gamification and for-purpose misinformation techniques. It is possible because gig workers and
customers have no other option but to trust the platform for its efficiency and the underlying operation of the
platform is opaque to users and configurable only by the operating central company. Therefore the platform
operator:

       benefit, and doing it e.g. by blocking them from access to the platform</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >We are proposing a P2P protocol designed for the gig economy that, by eliminating the need for central online platforms, will
create a new decentralized, P2P gig economy (Figure <a 
href="#x1-1007r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decent --></a>). Gig workers will be engaged directly by the end customer and can
accomplish their tasks and earn money on a free market without the need for the existence of a central organization. Quality of
service delivery and conflict resolution is preserved by payment settlers - companies that earn their revenue by assuring
compliance consistency of the system - the ability to maintain compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and standards
consistently over time.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >The lack of central organization also means that minimal data is shared between gig workers customers and payment settlers.
Just enough to fulfil the job according to the protocol-driven off-chain smart contract that uses P2P money i.e. Bitcoin [<a 
href="#Xnakamoto2009bitcoin">7</a>]
directly (using on-chain Hashed Time-Lock Contract - HTLC [<a 
href="#Xpoon2016bitcoin">8</a>]) or by using Lightning Network [<a 
href="#Xpoon2016bitcoin">8</a>] (using HODL Invoices)
forming layer 3 protocol from the Bitcoin perspective.

independently and in the event of receiving a message that needs to be broadcasted it forwards it to its peers
(Figure&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >The core task of Gig-gossip protocol is to broadcast a job proposal (topic) to interested parties and collect job offers (reply
messages) from interested contractors. Economically, the customer is interested in exchanging their money for the service,
while gig worker is interested in being paid for the job done. The network to sustain its existence needs to reward
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
broadcasters for the quality of the broadcasting. Therefore the protocol is constructed in a way that the customer
broadcasts a topic, that contains an anonymous job description. This job description is delivered by the network to
the gig worker that is happy to respond with an encrypted message that is targeted solely to the customer. The
message is delivered back to the customer that can verify the basic properties of the gig worker with their digital
certificate but to decrypt the contact information allowing for further P2P communication with the gig worker, the
customer is obligated to pay the network and lock the required amount of money proposed in the job offer.
The payment settlement is secured by payment settlers - companies that secure compliance consistency of the
system.

X.509 certificates [<a

communities. For a taxi driver, the screening requires having a valid driving licence and no criminal record. The payment settler
can issue this kind of certificate by signing it with its private key so anyone can verify that the specific certificate was truly
issued by the issuing organization. If the certificate is revoked the information about it is published by the issuing
organization in form of a revocation list. Public key certificates usually contain also a public key of the certified

identifier that allows one to determine this situation and react accordingly to the node policy. Some nodes might wish not to
broadcast the RequestPayload more than once, others if working on small fanout might wish to broadcast the same
RequestPayload many times. Anyway, it is the requested responsibility to ensure the uniqueness of payload_id, risking that if it

<!--l. 243--><p class="noindent" >Message broadcast in Gig-gossip is protected with the idea of Proof of Work. POW was introduced in HashCash [<a 
href="#XHashcash">1</a>] and
famously implemented in bitcoin mining but was originally introduced to limit email spam. The thinking here is that if the
originator needs to make some significant computation to be able to send the message it will significantly increase the cost of
spam and DDoS attacks.
</p><!--l. 245--><p class="noindent" >There are many possible POW schemas (e.g. SHA hash-based POW, similar to the one implemented in the bitcoin network [<a 
href="#Xnakamoto2009bitcoin">7</a>]).
In Gig-gossip, given the topic, the middleman decides the kind and how complex POW is required to be computed by the
originator to allow further spreading of this topic. For example in the case of hash-based POW, the task is to compute the hash
of the specific payload so the hash itself is lower or equal to a specific target. The larger target is the more complex and costly
the computation is. On the other hand, once the hash is computed, it is easy to verify that it fits into the specific
target, so the broadcaster has an easy task to verify that the originator has done the work to compute the correct
hash.

the sender) from the participating middlemen. During the broadcast phase, the onion grows layer by layer. Active
peer appends its address to the onion and is using the public key of the next peer to encrypt the grown onion,
therefore only the next peer can decrypt that layer of the onion. Once encrypted the onion is passed to the next
peer.

choose the one that has the minimal network fee. Therefore, here we allow for multiple crossing of the same node with the
same topic on purpose, being a decision made by the node owner. The number of times the node sends the same topic is called
here multibroadcast number. Multibroadcast=1 means the topic is broadcasted by the same node only once
and multibroadcast&#x003E;1 means same topic more than once. Gig-gossip is using onion routing to hide the route
information, therefore multibroadcast&#x003E;1 can result in routes that are crossing same nodes multiple times. This can
result in very complex routes that will be naturally very expensive and therefore they will be rejected by the
sender.

<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >A cryptographic key can be used as a preimage for generating a payment hash for the invoice. Such a key might allow the
description of the specific encrypted message. In other words, having a message that is encrypted with a specific key we
can construct an invoice using the key as a preimage and compute its payment hash. To decode the message
payer needs to pay the invoice and the key (preimage) needs to be revealed by the settler (that will settle the
payment).
</p><!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >We can create a chain of issuers that are becoming middlemen between the payer and settler (Figure <a 
href="#x1-12001r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cryptopaychain --></a>). The settler generates
the preimage (cryptographic key) and uses it to encrypt the specific message that is revealed to the public. The settler issue the
invoice containing the payment hash for the generated preimage. Issuers in the chain, one after another are generating HODL
invoices using the same payment hash received from the settler. Once the payer is reached and the payer pays
the invoice and this triggers the chain of payments that eventually reaches the settler. The settler reveals the
preimage making the payment settlement and the preimage being the key allows to decode the message. In other
words, the HODL invoice ensures all the issuers that the payment was made (invoices are in the accepted state)
but to have control of the money, they need to use the preimage, so all the chain needs to see the preimage,
therefore they are forced to pay invoices of their peers. Once the last invoice is paid to the settler, the settler reveals
the preimage and all the invoices are settled at the same time. Also as the preimage = key, the message can be
decoded.

 id="x1-180004.3.1"></a>The Silent Attack</h5>
<!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >The adversary tries to distort the distribution of the gossipy nodes to cause propagation failure by failing to respond to the
gossip protocol [<a 
href="#XAdHocNet">3</a>]. The same behaviour can be just a result of node failure that can happen naturally, especially with mobile
devices described in section <a 
href="#x1-160004.2">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: mobdev --></a>
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-190004.3.2"></a>Chaterbox Attack</h5>
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" >A malicious node retransmits repeatedly the same message [<a 
href="#XAdHocNet">3</a>]. This is solved in Gig-gossip by timestamp_tolerance
included in POWBroadcastFrame that makes the frame POW impossible to use after the timestamp_tolerance is
reached.
</p><!--l. 459--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-200004.3.3"></a>Sybil Attack</h5>
<!--l. 460--><p class="noindent" >This is the most common form of attack in P2P networks, since creating large numbers of identities is generally, cheap
resource-wise, unless cryptographic puzzles are included as part of joining the system [<a 
href="#XGossipSub">10</a>]. This is solved in Git-gossip with
POW.
</p><!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-210004.3.4"></a>Eclipse Attack</h5>
<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent" >This attack can be carried out against a single victim or the whole network. The objective is to silence the victim
by refusing to propagate messages from it or to distort its view by delaying message propagation towards it
[<a 
href="#XGossipSub">10</a>]. Here the attack can be performed against a specific payment settler but the multibroadcast&#x003E;1 makes it
impossible.
</p><!--l. 467--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.5    </span> <a 
 id="x1-220004.3.5"></a>Censorship Attack</h5>
<!--l. 468--><p class="noindent" >Sybils seek to establish themselves in the mesh and propagate all messages except those published by the target peer. In
contrast to the Eclipse Attack, in the Censorship Attack Sybils appear to behave properly from all vantage points, but
hairpin-drop the victim&#8217;s messages. The objective of the attacker is to censor the target and prevent its messages from reaching
the rest of the network [<a 
href="#XGossipSub">10</a>]. This is solved by the combination of POW and allowing payment settlers work on the free
makret.
</p><!--l. 470--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3.6    </span> <a 
 id="x1-230004.3.6"></a>Covert Flash Attack</h5>
<!--l. 471--><p class="noindent" >In the Covert Flash Attack, Sybils connect to the network but behave properly for some time in order to build up the score.
Then, they execute a coordinated attack whereby they stop propagating messages altogether in an attempt to completely disrupt
the network. The attack is difficult to identify before the attackers turn malicious as they behave properly up to that point and
build a good profile [<a 
href="#XGossipSub">10</a>]. This attack is resolved on the free market, gig gossip will implicitly punish with time the bad
behaviour as less economical than proper one.
