# Profile Setup Guide 

Setting up your profile is a breeze. The unique identifier is your `pubkey` and you sign messages with your `privkey` in the Nostr protocol. Remember, the `pubkey` gets derived from the `privkey`, hence generating a `privkey` becomes the initial step for new users. Make sure to store your `privkey` safely.

## Getting Started: App Launch Screen

Once you install and launch the app, choose the login option:

```
+--------------------------------+
|   üéâ Setup Your Profile        |
|                                |
|  [ Login With Your PrivKey üîë] |
|  [ Create New Profile üìù ]     |
|  [ Recover Existing Profile ]  | 
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```
## Quick Access: Log In With Your PrivKey

You can swiftly access the platform if you already have your privkey.

```
+--------------------------------+
|   üîíLogin With Your PrivKey    |
|                                |
|  Enter your PrivKey:           |
|                                |
|  [.........................]   |
|                                |
|                    [ Next ‚û°Ô∏è ]  |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

## Start Fresh: Create New Profile

Alternatively, you can also create a new profile which primarily involves generating your recovery mnemonic. Ensure you write these 12 words down. These words are generated using BIP39 ([https://bips.xyz/39](https://bips.xyz/39)).

```
+--------------------------------+
|   üíº Create New Profile        |
|                                |
|  Your recovery mnemonic:       |
|                                |
| +----------------------------+ |
| | image  debate else  control| |
| | amused inform salon slow   | |
| | chief  divide route apology| |
| +----------------------------+ |
|                                |
|  Write them down now notepad!  |
|                    [ Next ‚û°Ô∏è ]  |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

## Backup Plan: Recover Existing Profile

If you already have your recovery mnemonic, select the `Recover Existing Profile`. This will lead to the recreation of your privkey from the seed encoded in the mnemonic.

```
+--------------------------------+
|   ‚è™ Recover Existing Profile  |
|                                |
|  Enter your recovery mnemonic: |
|                                |
|  [....] [....] [....] [....]   |
|  [....] [....] [....] [....]   |
|  [....] [....] [....] [....]   |
|                                |
|                    [ Next ‚û°Ô∏è ]  |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

## Added Security: Allow FaceID

To further enhance security, the app employs the iPhone's FaceID feature to secure the account and its details.

```
+--------------------------------+
|   üë§ Allow FaceID              |
|                                |
|  Would you like to enable      |
|  FaceID for this app?          |
|                                |
|                    [ Yes ‚úîÔ∏è ]   |
|                    [ No ‚ùå ]   |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

A quick scan secures your login.

```
+--------------------------------+
|                                |
|         üîí Login               |
|                                |
|   Scanning your face...        |
|          +-     -+             |
|          | o J o |             |
|          | \___/ |             |
|          +-     -+             |
|                                |
| If you're having trouble,      |
| try repositioning your face or |
| scanning again.                |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

## Trust Enforcers: Verification

The app is using a network of Trust Enforcers that manage the trust and safty of the network. Trust Enforcers add an extra layer of security within the app's network. To be validated by one or more preferred Trust Enforcer, you need to go through a basic verification process involving mobile phone validation through SMS. Having mobile phone verification adds an extra layer of security.

```
+--------------------------------+
|   üõ°Ô∏è Add Trust Enforcer        |
|                                |
|  Enter domain name of new      |
|  Trust Enforcer:               |
|                                |
|  [.........................]   |
|                                |
|  Enter your mobile number for  |
|  verification:                 |
|                                |
|  [+.....][..................]  |
|                                |
|                    [ Add ‚ûï ]  |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+
```

In this interface, you need to provide two pieces of information:
1. **Domain name** of the new Trust Enforcer.
2. Your **mobile phone number**.

After entering these details, tap on `Add`. The Trust Enforcer will verify your mobile number as part of their validation process. Remember, providing accurate details ensures a smooth and secure experience.


You need to input the code that you received via SMS from the Trust Enforcer. After entering these details, tap on `Submit`. The Trust Enforcer will verify your code and if it is correct, you will be able to use it.

```
+--------------------------------------+
|        üõ°Ô∏è Add Trust Enforcer         |
|                                      |
|   Enter the 6-digit SMS code sent    |
|   to your mobile number:             |
|                                      |
|         [.][.][.][.][.][.]           |
|                                      |

|                                      |
+--------------------------------------+
```

Below is the list of validated Trust Enforcers where you can manage your list.
